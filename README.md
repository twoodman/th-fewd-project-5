- ~~ponder the complexities of a black hole~~ always
- ~~make nav anchor hover cleaner~~ ✔️
- ~~minify styles and js (if keeping)? probably.~~ ✔️
- ~~go through Sass and modify for best practices (@includes first, mostly)~~ ✔️
- ~~add some extends to meet 'exceed expectations' requirements of project~~ ✔️
- ~~add visible/invisible comments to sass where appropriate~~ ✔️
- ~~add mobile nav per 'exceeds expectations'~~ ✔️
- ~~more coffee~~ ✔️ x4
- ~~put html through validator~~ ✔️ | first validation: no errors

Exceeds Expectations:
- ~~Create multiple subfolders (more than 3) for organizing styles.~~ ✔️
- ~~Create multiple SCSS partial files (more than 3).~~ ✔️
- ~~Multiple (more than 1)placeholder selectors~~ ✔️
- ~~Multiple (more than 3) uses of @extends with placeholders~~ ✔️
- ~~Multiple (more than 1) additional Sass variables (not just color, font-size, font-family).~~ ✔️
- ~~Include at least 1 additional mixin for other code (not just for media queries)~~ ✔️
- ~~Create more than 3 nested Sass rules where appropriate.~~ ✔️
- ~~Using JavaScript or CSS/Sass, include an icon that, when clicked toggles the navigation on and off when on mobile screen sizes.~~ ✔️


🔧Fix:

- Use \@include for adding content to mixin media queries
- Speed up mobile nav menu open/close (cut time in half from 600ms to 300ms)
- Add more comments
- Remove ALL IDs (for styling), add classes
- Duplicate class attr on top nav - founnd by validating 🔥🔥
- Change all 'done' in README to ✔️
